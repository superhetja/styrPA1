## Anything else
'''
This program was fun to write, we got more understanding for the material of this course and got better skills in c++, tho we didn't have enough time to watch out for memory leaks.

One thing, we think that the project description, it's way to long and misleading. Not clear on instructions what needs to be returned and what not looking at the expected output. 1 zip file would be sufficent with expected and input, and 1 pdf file with descriptions of the project.
